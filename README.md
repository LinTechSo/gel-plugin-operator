# GelOp
K8s Operator for Grafana Enterprise Logs plugin

## Description
Operator for tenant management and LBAC creation.

For more information about Grafana Enterprise Logs visit [GEL](https://grafana.com/docs/enterprise-logs/latest/)

**Note:** This Operator uses GEL v3 Admin API requests to create configurations

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).
 
1. Create a Tenant
```
apiVersion: loki.hamravesh.com/v1alpha1
kind: GrafanaEnterpriseLogsTenant
metadata:
  name: grafanaenterpriselogstenant-sample
spec:
  tenantInfo:
    name: "mytenant"
    displayName: "mytenant"
    clusterName: "loki"
```
2. Create a LBAC
```
apiVersion: loki.hamravesh.com/v1alpha1
kind: GrafanaEnterpriseLogsAccessPolicy
metadata:
  name: grafanaenterpriselogsaccesspolicy-sample
spec:
  tenantInfoRef: 
    tenantName: "mytenant"
    clusterName: "loki"
    accessPolicies:
      -  "logs:read"
      -  "logs:write"
    labelSelectors:
      - '{foo="bar"}'
      - '{name="hello"}'
```


### Running on the cluster
1. Checkout the deployment env
```
export Loki_Endpoint_Address="http://loki.com"
export Loki_Admin_Api_Token="X"
```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

3. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/gel:tag
```

4. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/gel:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Add Loki Endpoint credentials as an ENV
```
export Loki_Endpoint_Address="http://loki.com"
export Loki_Admin_Api_Token="X"
```

2. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

3. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
